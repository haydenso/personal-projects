1. Write a program to sum all the items in a list.
2. Write a program to get the largest number from a list.
3. Write a program to count the number of strings where the string length is 2 or more and the first and last character are same from a given list of strings.
4. Write a program to remove duplicates from a list.
5. Write a function that takes two lists and returns True if they have at least one common member.
6. Write a program to print a specified list after removing the 0th, 4th and 5th elements. Sample List : ['Red', 'Green', 'White', 'Black', 'Pink', 'Yellow'] Expected Output : ['Green', 'White', 'Black']
7. Write a program to print the numbers of a specified list after removing even numbers from it.
8. Write a program to select an item randomly from a list, which is then removed from the original list so it canâ€™t be re-drawn (just like a deck of cards scenario)
9. Write a program to generate and print a list of first and last 5 elements where the values are square of numbers between 1 and 30 (both included).
10. Given two lists, write a program to print the items that are not in both lists.
11.Write a program to append the items from one list to a second list.
12. Write a program for computing primes up to 1000. Hint: Google for the Sieve of Eratosthenes
